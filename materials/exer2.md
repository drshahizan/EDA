# Exercise 2: Loading Data with Pandas

How you obtain the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, post it to Google Colab, then import it into a Pandas DataFrame. The first few rows will be displayed using the `head()` method.

## Option 1: Dataset in Google Colab

### Step 1: Download the Titanic Dataset
1. **Go to Kaggle:**
   - Visit the [Titanic dataset page on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

2. **Download the Dataset:**
   - Click on the "Download All" button to download the dataset as a ZIP file.
   - Extract the ZIP file on your computer to access the `train.csv` file.
   - [File: train.csv](https://github.com/drshahizan/dataset/blob/main/titanic/train.csv)

### Step 2: Upload the Dataset to Google Colab
1. **Open Google Colab:**
   - Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and create a new notebook if you haven't already.

2. **Upload the File:**
   - In Colab, click on the folder icon on the left sidebar to open the file explorer.
   - Click on the upload icon (a paperclip) at the top of the file explorer.
   - Select the `train.csv` file from your computer and upload it.

### Step 3: Load the Dataset into a pandas DataFrame
1. **Import Required Libraries:**
   - In the first code cell, type the following code to import pandas:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd
     ```

2. **Load the Dataset:**
   - In the next code cell, type the following code to load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame:
     ```python
     df = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
     ```

3. **Display the First Few Rows:**
   - In the next code cell, type the following code to display the first few rows of the DataFrame:
     ```python
     df.head()
     ```
## Option 2: Dataset in Github

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Open Google Colab:**
   - Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

2. **Create a New Notebook:**
   - Click on "File" > "New Notebook".

3. **Import Necessary Libraries:**
   - In the first code cell, import the necessary libraries:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd
     ```

4. **Download the Dataset from GitHub:**
   - In the next code cell, use the following code to download the dataset using `wget`:
     ```python
     !wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drshahizan/dataset/main/titanic/train.csv -O train.csv
     ```

5. **Load the Dataset into a Pandas DataFrame:**
   - In the next code cell, load the dataset and display the first few rows:
     ```python
     df = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
     df.head()
     ```

By following these steps, you will have successfully downloaded the Titanic dataset, uploaded it to Google Colab, loaded it into a pandas DataFrame, and displayed the first few rows using the `head()` method.
